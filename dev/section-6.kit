                <p>The red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) is a favorite for its remarkable adaptations. Its bulging red eyes are its telltale feature, but it is also known for its neon-green body, accented with vertical blue and yellow stripes on the sides and bright orange or reddish feet.</p>
